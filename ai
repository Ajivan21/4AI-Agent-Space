Agent Space Overview
Agent Space is an open-source framework designed to intelligently route tasks to the most suitable AI agents. It automatically assigns tasks based on tags, runs the execution, evaluates results, and delivers the final output—end to end.

4AI Agent Space Framework

Key Components
🔥 Pioneer
Initiates tasks by attaching relevant tags and task instructions { tag: 1+4, task }.

🚀 Root Agent
Acts as the master coordinator—selects the best agents from the cluster and evaluates their outputs to produce the final result.

🌐 Agent Cluster
A collection of specialized agents (A, B, C, D, etc.), each assigned capability tags such as 1, 2, 1+2, 3, 4.

Option 2 – Developer-Focused

Agent Space Introduction
Agent Space is a modular, open-source AI framework that dynamically selects, executes, and evaluates agents based on task requirements. By leveraging a tag-based system, it ensures optimal agent selection and high-quality results.

Core Architecture
🔥 Pioneer Layer – Dispatches tagged tasks
🚀 Root Agent – Orchestrates agent selection and result evaluation
🌐 Agent Cluster – Specialized agents grouped by functional tags

Option 3 – Short & Technical

Agent Space is an open-source AI orchestration framework that automates agent selection, task execution, and result validation using a tag-based architecture.

🔥 Pioneer → 🚀 Root Agent → 🌐 Agent Cluster
From task initiation to final output, everything is handled intelligently and efficiently.

Option 4 – Contribution-Friendly

Getting Started with Agent Space
Agent Space enables developers to build, register, and orchestrate AI agents through a tag-based open framework. Tasks are automatically routed, executed, evaluated, and returned with minimal manual intervention.

Agent Registration
When registering an agent, tags must accurately represent its capabilities—incorrect tags may impact performance ratings.

{
  "url": "https://4AI.agent/agent-1",
  "name": "agent 1",
  "tag": {1, 3, 4}
}

Option 5 – Community / GitHub Readme Style

Agent Space is an open-source AI agent framework built for scalability and collaboration. It intelligently matches tasks with the right agents, evaluates outcomes, and delivers reliable results.
